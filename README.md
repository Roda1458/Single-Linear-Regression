# Single Linear Regression and Boston Housing Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves two primary analyses using linear regression:

1. **Single Linear Regression Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Apply linear regression to a simple dataset to evaluate model performance.
   - **Dataset**:
     - `x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
     - `y = [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12]`
   - **Tasks**:
     - Compute regression coefficients using the analytic formulation.
     - Calculate Sum Squared Error (SSE) and R² value.
     - Implement and compare Full-Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent methods.
     - Evaluate and compare performance using metrics such as SSE and R².

2. **Boston Housing Rate Dataset Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the Boston Housing dataset to identify the key predictor of housing prices and apply regression techniques.
   - **Dataset**: Boston Housing Rate Dataset, which includes various features related to housing prices.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Determine which feature has the strongest linear relationship with housing prices.
     - Implement both analytic formulation and gradient descent (Full-Batch and Stochastic) to compute regression coefficients.
     - Compare results using performance metrics like SSE and R².
